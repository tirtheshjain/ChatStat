"
",,,
"CSE Dept review is scheduled on 6th/7th October 2023.
",,,
"
",,,
An external committee of renowned experts will be coming to review all aspects of our department,"and interact with students from ALL programmes (BTech, MTech, MS and PhD).
",,
"This review is scheduled after years and needless to say is very important for the department.
",,,
"
",,,
Regarding MS,"HOD mam has asked as many MS Students to be present in the review.
",,
"The tentative timing for interaction with MS students is *7th October 10:45am - 11:15am*.
",,,
We will need students from MS1,"MS2 and MS3, and from each pool (Theory, Systems and AI/ML).
",,
"
",,,
"I urge as many people to join as possible. Please fill the form if you are joining : https://forms.gle/c3zsiwrJHQRczT1X7
",,,
9/28/23,2:56 PM ,+91 88009 81094,This review is happening after 7-8 years and is very important for our dept. Ma'am is very serious about this and wants around *30-40 M.Techs.*
"Timing for interaction with MTechs: 3:00 - 3:30pm (6th October).
",,,
9/28/23,2:57 PM ,+91 99691 99780,"Hi everyone, "
"the scheduled time for interaction with MS Students is *6th Oct (Friday) 3:30pm - 4:15pm*
",,,
"Apologies for the miscommunication.
",,,
9/28/23,10:10 PM ,+91 91756 42032,Hey guys! 👋
"Today is the last day to register for the trek. 🏞️
",,,
"Please don't miss this if you are interested. 🥾🌄
",,,
9/29/23,4:43 PM ,+91 99691 99780,‼️*IMPORTANT*‼️
"Given the batch strength the review committee is expecting at least *25-30 MS students* and *30-40 MTech students*. 
",,,
"So far only 11 have confirmed:
",,,
"MS-1 : 2
",,,
"MS-2 : 4
",,,
"MS-5 : 5
",,,
"
",,,
I understand everyone is busy at the moment,"but this sends a really bad message to an external review committee who is *coming and designating time just to speak with you guys*.
",,
"
",,,
*MS3 and MTech2 is neck deep in placements,"and is still participating in majority compared to others.*
",,
" 
",,,
I urge everyone to please take this review seriously. This review is happening after 9 years and whatever the committee takes back from here is going to effect everyone in the department (profs,"staff and students alike).
",,
"
",,,
"We are not asking for much your time. The tentative schedule is as follows:
",,,
"*Interaction with MTech Students : 6th Oct (Friday)  3:00 - 3:35pm* 
",,,
"*Interaction with MS Students : 6th Oct (Friday)  3:35pm - 4:15pm*
",,,
"
",,,
The commitee wont ask any difficult questions,"they just want to know your experience here in IITB CSE dept, the changes you want to see and the problems you face. Profs wont be present during the interaction session, but needless to say, you have to maintain professionalism when speaking with them.
",,
"
",,,
*Both MTech and MS*,"please fill the form here :  https://forms.gle/bWtrkmBFxsnKSYRU9
",,
"(Mtech can select None option in the ""pool"" question)
